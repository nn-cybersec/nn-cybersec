      <h1>Privacy Policy (Personal Data Processing)</h1>
      <p class="note">Publication date: <time datetime="2025-10-20">20 Oct 2025</time></p>

      <h2>1. General Provisions</h2>
      <p>
        This Policy defines the procedure and conditions for processing personal data (PD) of participants of
        the “International Young Scientists School ‘Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity’” (the “Event”).
        It applies to all PD collected via the registration form and other communication channels within the
        preparation and conduct of the Event.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Personal Data Controller</h2>
      <p>
        Controller: <strong>North-Caucasus Federal University (NCFU)</strong><br>
        Address: <strong>1 Pushkina St., 355017, Stavropol, Russia</strong> • TIN/OGRN: <strong>2635014955 / 1022601961580</strong><br>
        PD inquiries: <a href="mailto:nn-cybersec@mail.ru">nn-cybersec@mail.ru</a>
      </p>

      <h2>3. Scope of Data Processed</h2>
      <p>
        We process the data you provide in the registration form: last name, first name, patronymic (if any),
        date of birth, organization, position, city, and e-mail. Other data may be processed only if provided
        voluntarily and for the stated purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Purposes and Legal Grounds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>organization and conduct of the Event; communication with participants;</li>
        <li>issuing passes/certificates; sending programs and notifications;</li>
        <li>statistical and reporting purposes; archival storage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Legal grounds: your <strong>consent</strong> to PD processing (Art. 6 of Federal Law No. 152-FZ)
        and/or necessity to conclude and perform an agreement on participation.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Processing Actions</h2>
      <p>
        Collection, recording, systematization, storage, updating, use, transfer under instruction,
        anonymization, blocking, deletion, and destruction of PD.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Processors and Third-Party Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        The registration and storage of applications use <strong>Yandex Forms</strong> (Yandex acts as a processor
        on behalf of the Controller). Additional processors may include the website hosting provider and e-mail
        services for notifications. Transfers are based on contracts/public terms ensuring PD protection requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Storage Location and Localization</h2>
      <p>
        Initial recording and storage of PD of Russian citizens are carried out within the territory of the Russian
        Federation (Art. 18.1 of Federal Law No. 152-FZ).
      </p>

      <h2>8. Retention Period</h2>
      <p>
        Until the purposes are achieved and/or for <strong>3 years</strong> after the Event ends, or until consent is withdrawn,
        unless a longer period is required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Data Subject Rights</h2>
      <p>
        You have the right to obtain information about processing, request rectification, blocking or deletion of PD,
        object to processing, and withdraw your consent. Requests may be sent to the Controller’s postal address or
        by e-mail at <a href="mailto:nn-cybersec@mail.ru">nn-cybersec@mail.ru</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Withdrawal of Consent</h2>
      <p>
        You may withdraw consent at any time by sending an e-mail titled “Withdrawal of consent to PD processing” to
        <a href="mailto:nn-cybersec@mail.ru">nn-cybersec@mail.ru</a>. Upon receipt, processing will cease except where
        continued processing is permitted by law.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Security Measures</h2>
      <p>
        The Controller applies legal, organizational, and technical measures to protect PD against unlawful access,
        destruction, modification, blocking, copying, and dissemination, including access control, processing logs,
        and backup procedures.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Cookies and Logs</h2>
      <p>
        The website may use cookies and web server technical logs solely to ensure website functionality and for
        aggregated statistics. Marketing trackers are not used without separate consent.
      </p>
